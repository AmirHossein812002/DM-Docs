# Clustering Analysis

## Meaningful Features Clustering 

### Feature Selection

To cluster movies meaningfully, the following features were selected:

#### Numerical Features:

- **Popularity**: A measure of how well-known a movie is.
- **Vote Average**: The average rating a movie has received.
- **ROI (Revenue-to-Budget Ratio)**: Indicates financial success relative to the movie's budget.

#### Categorical Features:

- **Genres**: Transformed into binary columns using one-hot encoding to represent each genre as a separate feature.

---

### KMeans Clustering

#### Objective

To group movies into distinct clusters using the KMeans algorithm and determine the optimal number of clusters based on the Silhouette Score.

#### Results

- **Best Silhouette Score:** `0.7686`
- **Optimal Number of Clusters:** `3`

#### Cluster Sizes

The number of movies in each cluster is as follows:

| Cluster       | Number of Movies |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Cluster 0** | 19,881           |
| **Cluster 2** | 704              |
| **Cluster 1** | 20               |

#### Visualization

Clusters were visualized using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction:

![alt text](/src/public/phase-2/image-5.png)

#### Analysis

- **Cluster 0:** Contains the majority of movies with average `vote_average` and `ROI`.
- **Cluster 3:** The second-largest cluster, representing movies with higher average `vote_average`.
- **Cluster 2:** A smaller cluster with the highest average `vote_average`.
- **Cluster 6:** A very small cluster with distinctively high `vote_average`.
- **Noise Points:** DBSCAN inherently identifies noise points (not included in the clusters) that donâ€™t fit well with others in the dataset.

---

### Conclusion

#### Summary

The clustering analysis using both **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** provided meaningful insights into the movie dataset:

- **KMeans Clustering:**

  - Grouped movies into 3 clusters, with clear separation in PCA visualization.
  - Identified a small cluster (Cluster 1) of movies with exceptionally high ROI, likely representing blockbuster hits or niche successes.
  - Majority of movies were in Cluster 0, representing general characteristics with moderate popularity and ROI.

- **DBSCAN Clustering:**
  - Identified 7 clusters (excluding noise), with varying sizes.
  - Captured smaller clusters like Cluster 2 (highest `vote_average`) and Cluster 6 (distinctively high `vote_average`).
  - Highlighted noise points in the data, showcasing DBSCAN's ability to handle outliers.

#### Observations

- **Feature Contributions:** Both clustering methods demonstrated that `vote_average` and `ROI` played significant roles in forming distinct groups.
- **Algorithm Strengths:**
  - KMeans is effective for balanced clustering but struggles with irregular shapes or noise.
  - DBSCAN is better at identifying smaller, irregular clusters and outliers.
